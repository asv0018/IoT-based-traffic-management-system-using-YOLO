# IoT-based-traffic-management-system-using-YOLO
This project is based on ESP32 cameras where they stream the images to the PC, where the main program or the application is executed. The applicaton used is YOLO based object detection, which is used to obtain the count of the vehicles. The count is updated to the firebase, for the ESP8266 to have an access and update the traffic timer accordingly.
